# Description:
As an early-career Data Scientist, I have been looking for an ideal platform to share my professional experience and highlight projects I have undertaken outside of my organization's enterprise envrionment. After much thought, I have decided on creating a professional Data Science portfolio which is coded in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), rendered in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), updated and made reproducible with [GitHub](https://github.com/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Skills:
Throughout this week-long project, I have had to draw upon and learn the following skills:
- Quarto
- CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets)
- SCSS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
- Markdown
- Website Deployment (with Netlify)
