Code of Conduct adapted from [Jadey Ryan](https://jadeyryan.com/license), who modified from [Cédric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/top/conduct/) and [Tim O'Reilly](http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/04/draft-bloggers-code-of-conduct.html).

I value kindness and inclusivity. This means that I will not post unacceptable content, and I will delete any references or comments that contain it. [I define unacceptable content as anything included or linked to that:]{.underline}  

- is being used to abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others
- is libelous, knowingly false, ad-hominem, or misrepresents another person
- infringes upon a copyright or trademark
- violates an obligation of confidentiality
- violates the privacy of others

I define and determine what is “unacceptable content” on a case-by-case basis, and my definitions are not limited to this list. If I delete a comment or link, I will say so and explain why. I reserve the right to change these standards at any time with no notice.
